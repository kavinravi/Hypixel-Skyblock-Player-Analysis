# Hypixel Player Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize data from Hypixel player statistics. Using a combination of .ipynb, .csv, and .txt files, I process player data to derive meaningful insights about top players and other categories. The analysis is carried out in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## Files Included
Data Files:

top_250_players.txt - Contains the usernames of the top 250 players in Hypixel based on selected criteria.

random_players.txt - Includes usernames of randomly selected players for comparison purposes.

final_all_players.csv - A consolidated dataset of all players used for analysis, including top and random players.

final_all_players.txt - A text version of the consolidated dataset for quick reference.

final_players_mode - the actual data used for modeling, visualization, and analysis



Notebooks:

grabbing_hypixel_data.ipynb - Code to scrape or process raw Hypixel data and prepare it for analysis, not needed due to presence of "final_players_mode.csv"

model-code-and-visualization.ipynb - Contains code for building models and visualizing the insights derived from the player data.
